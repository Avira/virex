What is Virex?

Virex is a web based application developed by the Avira Operations GmbH & Co. KG and is published to the community under the New BDS License. The application is based on the Norman Sample Sharing framework and is able to organize your malicious samples, clean samples and URLs. Virex offers various statistics as example the amount of downloaded samples by a sharing partner, the amount of newly added samples by the owner of the system as well as statistics about file size and traffic.

Furthermore the application contains a complex user management for internal as well as for external users. It supports enabling and disabling user accounts, changing PGP keys, limit the rights of the sample sharing to different collection types as example malware, clean and URLs. Additionally there is an account history for each user available as example the last requested samples or the last requested list of MD5 or SHA256 hashes. The download of samples can be limited for each user by a limitation date. This means that starting the exchange together with a new sharing partner can really start at a defined date.
